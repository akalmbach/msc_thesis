\SetAbstractEnText{
This thesis considers unsupervised learning of interpretable spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal maps. More specifically, we are interested in learning to represent complex data in ways that facilitate understanding how it varies over space and time. We focus on learning semantic map representations that are \emph{sparse}, meaning most locations are described by few types, and \emph{smooth}, meaning most locations are described by the same types as their neighbors. We investigate how a spatio-temporal topic model -- a descendent of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and other probabilistic latent variable models -- can be used to learn such representations for problems outside the typical text domain associated with LDA. We apply spatio-temporal topic models to a broad range of domains including modelling ambient audio, phytoplankton populations, and images observed by a robotic camera. In developing this variety of applications, we introduce novel interpretations of the learned topic model; beyond just unsupervised classification we also consider using the topic model to make predictions in feature space and in the space of raw observations. In our experiments we demonstrate that sparse and smooth map representations are more interpretable than alternative unsupervised representations. We evaluate this interpretability in terms of both alignment with natural human-centric representations as well as the ease of learning later supervised models.
